  <p>
    I have been a very keen hobby photographer for many years. In early 2019, I decided to turn my hobby into a profession
    I have started on a small scale, doing some family, maternity, newborn and matric farewell shoots.

    Please contact me if you are interested in a photo shoot, my prices are very reasonable,
    and I will shoot in the Benoni and surrounds area with no travel expenses if the location is less than 50km from Benoni.
